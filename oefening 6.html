    <p>The debut emblem appeared in 1994. It is based on the artistic combination of the letters “PS” – short for

        He proposed a three-dimensional logo, in which “P” is depicted standing, and “S” lying as if it were the shadow of
        the first letter. The semi-ovals are played in an interesting way, for which the upper part of “P” is left open.
        Overall, this is a unique combination of text, graphics, and color.</p>
